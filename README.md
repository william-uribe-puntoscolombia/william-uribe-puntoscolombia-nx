## 📦 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a production-ready Angular monorepo with:

- **2 Applications**

  - `shop` - Angular e-commerce application with product listings and detail views
  - `api` - Backend API with Docker support serving product data

- **6 Libraries**

  - `@org/feature-products` - Product listing feature (Angular)
  - `@org/feature-product-detail` - Product detail feature (Angular)
  - `@org/data` - Data access layer for shop features
  - `@org/shared-ui` - Shared UI components
  - `@org/models` - Shared data models
  - `@org/products` - API product service library

- **E2E Testing**
  - `shop-e2e` - Playwright tests for the shop application

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd <your-repository-name>

# Install dependencies
# (Note: You may need --legacy-peer-deps)
npm install

# Serve the Angular shop application (this will simultaneously serve the API backend)
npx nx serve shop

# ...or you can serve the API separately
npx nx serve api

# Build all projects
npx nx run-many -t build

# Run tests
npx nx run-many -t test

# Lint all projects
npx nx run-many -t lint

# Run e2e tests
npx nx e2e shop-e2e

# Run tasks in parallel

npx nx run-many -t lint test build e2e --parallel=3

# Visualize the project graph
npx nx graph
```

## ⭐ Featured Nx Capabilities

This repository showcases several powerful Nx features:

### 1. 🔒 Module Boundaries

Enforces architectural constraints using tags. Each project has specific dependencies it can use:

- `scope:shared` - Can be used by all projects
- `scope:shop` - Shop-specific libraries
- `scope:api` - API-specific libraries
- `type:feature` - Feature libraries
- `type:data` - Data access libraries
- `type:ui` - UI component libraries

**Try it out:**

```bash
# See the current project graph and boundaries
npx nx graph

# View a specific project's details
npx nx show project shop --web
```

[Learn more about module boundaries →](https://nx.dev/features/enforce-module-boundaries)

### 2. 🐳 Docker Integration

The API project includes Docker support with automated targets and release management:

```bash
# Build Docker image
npx nx docker:build api

# Run Docker container
npx nx docker:run api

# Release with automatic Docker image versioning
npx nx release
```

**Nx Release for Docker:** The repository is configured to use Nx Release for managing Docker image versioning and publishing. When running `nx release`, Docker images for the API project are automatically versioned and published based on the release configuration in `nx.json`. This integrates seamlessly with semantic versioning and changelog generation.

### 3. 🎭 Playwright E2E Testing

End-to-end testing with Playwright is pre-configured:

```bash
# Run e2e tests
npx nx e2e shop-e2e

# Run e2e tests in CI mode
npx nx e2e-ci shop-e2e
```

### 4. ⚡ Vitest for Unit Testing

Fast unit testing with Vite for Angular libraries:

```bash
# Test a specific library
npx nx test data

# Test all projects
npx nx run-many -t test
```

[Learn more about Vite testing →](https://nx.dev/recipes/vite)

### 5. 🔧 Self-Healing CI

The CI pipeline includes `nx fix-ci` which automatically identifies and suggests fixes for common issues:

```bash
# In CI, this command provides automated fixes
npx nx fix-ci
```

This feature helps maintain a healthy CI pipeline by automatically detecting and suggesting solutions for:

- Missing dependencies
- Incorrect task configurations
- Cache invalidation issues
- Common build failures

## 🏷️ Understanding Tags

This repository uses tags to enforce module boundaries:

| Project            | Tags                         | Can Import From              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `shop`             | `scope:shop`                 | `scope:shop`, `scope:shared` |
| `api`              | `scope:api`                  | `scope:api`, `scope:shared`  |
| `feature-products` | `scope:shop`, `type:feature` | `scope:shop`, `scope:shared` |
| `data`             | `scope:shop`, `type:data`    | `scope:shared`               |
| `models`           | `scope:shared`, `type:data`  | Nothing (base library)       |

## 🎯 Adding New Features

### Generate a new Angular application:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/angular:app my-app
```

### Generate a new Angular library:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/angular:lib my-lib
